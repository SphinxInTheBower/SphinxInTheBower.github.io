      <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
      <h1>The Breakfast Bower</h1>
      <p>Standing on the platform of the mansion’s northwest end, at what is today its main entrance, visitors might hear the gentle burbling of water. Stepping out from underneath a low and dark arch one discovers its source, a small pool with a fountain and the marble sculpture of a mixed creature—the sphinx.</p>

      <p>Paved with terracotta tiles and bordered by a low balustrade of stone planters, it conveys the atmosphere of a Mediterranean patio. Vines grow over ornamented bars behind the pool. Old photographs show several such bars lined up to form a pergola. Serving as trellis, but also for the attachments of awnings, flower pots and lamps, they made this a charming intermediate space. When entered from outside one had the impression to step into a room—complete with rugs and furniture; when accessed from inside the house, through the folding doors, one had the impression to step into nature with plants and running water.</p>

      <p>It is in this former Breakfast Bower that Mary Clark Thompson preferred to display most her Giustiniani marbles. Reliefs were inserted into the walls, such as those depicting Apollo, a helmeted head, or the front of a sarcophagus.</p>

      <p>Sculptures in the round, instead, were often rearranged. The bust of a woman, for example, that currently can be seen inside on the second floor, once stood on a pedestal next to the pool, another time on top of the wall with the sarcophagus relief and once was moved to the blue and white garden. The sphinx, itself an in-between, mixed creature, was freestanding, yet immovable, being a fixed element of the fountain. And this in turn showcased the constantly changing nature of water.</p>
